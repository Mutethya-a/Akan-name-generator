#### A simple web app that calculates the day of the week you were born and assigns you an Akan name based on your gender and birthday, April 2025  
#### By **Mutethya Nzioka**

## Description  
This application is inspired by the Ghanaian Akan tradition of naming children based on the day of the week they were born. The user inputs their date of birth and selects their gender, and the app returns their traditional Akan name based on that day.
